    <h1>How-To make a Blackjack game using Deck of Cards API</h1>
    Now, for the fun part...

    <h2>Planning:</h2>
    First, let's think about what we are trying to accomplish for a minute.
    To play Blackjack, we need to create a deck, draw cards, and maybe reshuffle
    our decks. Do we need a discard pile? A custom deck? Not unless we are planning
    on changing the Blackjack rules, which we are not. Usually,
    casinos play with 6-8 decks, so let's plan on using 7 decks. We will also need a way to
    deal, hit, and stand; the 3 most important parts of Blackjack. A way of keeping score,
    keeping count of card values, and a way to show who won will also be needed.

    <h2>Step 1-The HTML:</h2>
    <p>Let's start by creating a new text document and naming it Blackjack.html. Then, open
    it in your normal programming IDE or in Notepad if you have nothing better. Let's start
    with the basic HTML skeleton shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html1.png" />

    <p>
        Here, we changed title to Blackjack and the linked stylesheet to Blackjack.css, which we
        will address later. After you complete this skeleton, we will be concentrating on the body
        section only. If you open this HTML page, it should be white, but the title of the tab should
        say "Blackjack".
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, let's think of what we need for a Blackjack game. We need a dealer area for the dealer's cards,
        a player area for the player's cards, a way to differentiate them, a button to deal, a button to hit,
        a button to stand, maybe a score, and a place to display the current card total because no one likes
        doing mental math all the time.
    </p>
    <h4>Dealer and Player Areas:</h4>
    <p>From this point on, everything should be added inside the body of the HTML page.</p>
    <p>
        Let's start by adding the dealer and player areas. Let's make 2 Divs with the IDs set to id="dealerarea" and id="playerarea".
        The top div should be the dealer area so that the user is looking at their side of the table. Inside that each div, let's
        add a header 3 (h3) that says "Dealer: " and "Player: ". It should look like below:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html2.png" />
    <p>
        I think that inside that header would be a good place to put the notifications when you win or lose.
        So, let's go ahead and add a span inside each of those headers, next to "Player: " and "Dealer: ". We need to 
        put an id for each of these spans. Let's call the dealer's span id="dwin" and the player's to id="pwin".
    </p>
    <p>
        We need a place to keep track of the current total of the cards, too. So, let's add a header 5 (h5) that contains "Dealer Total:"
        and "Player Total:". We also need to add a span inside each header to update the score later with JavaScript. We should set
        these spans to have id="dtotal" and id"=ptotal". It should then look something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html3.png" />
    <p>
        For the final part of these divs, we should add in an area for the cards to be displayed. We will add the images of cards that
        the API sends us inside a new div. We can then easily delete all the image children inside this new div. So, between the 2 
        headers inside each div, add a new div. Set the IDs to id="dealer"" and id="player". This will give us a set location to put the
        card images that we receive from the API. It will look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html4.png" />
    <p>
        The next thing we need are 3 buttons for the 3 basic functions of Blackjack. So, make 3 buttons; Deal, Hit, and Stand. Set
        their IDs to id="deal", id="hit", and id="stand". Once you completed this, you HTML should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html5.png" />
    <p>And your webpage should now look like this:</p>
    <img src="images/html6.png" />
    <p> Now, we need to take those buttons we just made and put them inside divs. Place each button inside a div
    with the IDs being id="first", id="second", and id="third". Finally, but all 3 buttons and divs inside a single div with the id="wrapper".
    Once you complete this, your html should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html7.png" />
    <p>
        The final steps in making the HTML page is to add a score counter. We will incrememnt this value by 1 when the player wins
        and decrease it by 1 when the player loses. To add this, we will copy and paste the header and span that contains "Dealer: ".
        Once you have copied and pasted that underneath the wrapper div, change h3 to h5 and the span ID to id="score". After that
        is completed, add a script and set the source to src="Blackjack.js". The final HTML should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html8.png" />
    <p>And your webpage should now look like this:</p>
    <img src="images/html9.png" />
    <h2>Step 2-The CSS:</h2>
    <p>
        So, we have our website completed, but it doesn't look very pretty, does it? So, what do we need?
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A cool background and colored text</li>
        <li>larger and colorful buttons</li>
        <li>increase the size of the div for images</li>
        <li>set the size of the card images we will be adding</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The first step in making a CSS file is to create a new text document and name it "Blackjack.css". Remember how
        we added that name in our link of the HTML page? Now it comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with fixing the background. Go onto google images and find a nice background picture. I like green felt, as
        you can tell by the blackground picture of this how-to guide. Once you have found an image, download it to your computer
        and put it in the same folder as your Blackjack.html file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside your CSS file, type in "body" followed by an opening and closing squiggly brackets. Inside those brackets, type
        "background-image: url("felt.jpg");". background-image: changes to background of body. url("felt.jpg") changes the image
        to the location inside the parenthesis. Replace "felt.jpg" with the name of your image. Underneath the background-image, 
        add "color:yellow;". Color: changes the text color of all the text inside the body to yellow. I find yellow easier to read
        with a green background. After doing this and opening your HTML page, you should have a cool background and yellow text.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step is to create larger and colorful buttons. First, we need to adjust the wrapper div that contains the buttons.
        To adjust the div with the id of "wrapper", we need to type in #wrapper. Do this on the line under the closing squiggly bracket
        of the body. Then, add opening and closing squigglies next to #wrapper. Inside those squigglies, let's set the "overflow: normal;" 
        to stop the score from being displayed next to the wrapper.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the wrapper has been adjusted, create 3 more sections called #first, #second, and #third. Set them all to have "float:left;"
        and "width: 100px;". Your CSS file should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html10.png" />
    <p>
        We should now add some color and size to the buttons to make them easier to click and stand out more. We have 3 buttons, so we need
        to create #deal, #hit, and #stand sections in our CSS. Set all 3 to "width:80px" and "height:50px". This will set their width and height
        to a set 80 pixels and 50 pixels. Also, let's add a "background-color:" to each of the buttons. For deal, let's set it to "background-color:red;",
        hit to "cornflowerblue;", and stand to "yellowgreen;". Also, black lettering is hard to see on a red background, so let's change
        the color of text for deal to white with "color:white;". Once you have completed this, your HTML page should look like this when opened:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html11.png" />
    <p>
        Finally, we need to adjust the size of the card area. We don't have much space between "Dealer" and "Dealer Total" or "Player" and "Player Total".
        To fix this, we will do several things. The first thing we need to do is create #dealer and #player fields in our CSS file. Inside them,
        we need to set "height: 175px;" because 175px is a good height for a playing card on an average computer screen. The second step is
        to create am "img" field in the css. Since it is not an ID, it will change all img on the page, even img that we add later. Since we
        decided that 175px is a good height for a card, put that inside the img field as well. Also, with a height of 175px, 125px is a good width.
        So, add "width:125px;" to the img feild. Once complete, your HTML page should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/html12.png" />
    <p>Your CSS file should look like this:</p>
    <img src="images/html13.png" />
    <p>Our page now looks presentable. We can imagine the cards filling the dealer and player areas and the totals updating as you draw. Now comes
    the hard part, the JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>Step 3-The JavaScript:</h2>


        <div id="footer">
            <input id="prev" type="button" value="Previous"
                   onclick="window.open('explain.html', '_self');" />
            <input id="next" type="button" value="Next"
                   onclick="window.open('summary.html', '_self');" />
        </div>
</body>
</html>
