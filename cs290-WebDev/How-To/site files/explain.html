    <h1>What is Deck of Cards API?</h1>

    Deck of Cards API is a simple and straight forward API that is a great tool
    to use for someone who knows little to nothing about APIs. It is also very useful to
    anyone who wants to create a card game without having to code the decks in manually.

    <h2>What can it do?</h2>
    One of the great things about Deck of Cards is that it does not require an API ID.
    This means that anyone can use it without applying for an ID. This means that all you
    need to complete this tutorial is a way to create and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    No outside signups are necessary.
    <p>
        The Deck of Cards API can be called to return cards, create decks, and create discard
        piles. A list of calls and responses from the API can be viewed <a href="https://deckofcardsapi.com/">here</a>.

    <p>
        If you rather not read the Deck of Cards API website, I will breifly go over the different calls, what they do,
        and how to call them. If you chose to read the API website, click the "Making Blackjack" button at the top of the page 
        or scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "next" button to move on to the next step.

    <h3>Create a Deck:</h3>
    To create a deck, you need to call <span>
    "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=X" </span>
    where "X" is the number
    of decks you want to use. "shuffle" makes the API create the decks already shuffled. If you do not want them shuffled,
    you can leave that part off the link. The response that you get is in JSON format, so you should parse the response to make
    the information usable. The API returns if it was successful, the deck_id, if it was shuffled, and the number of remaining cards in JSON
    format. The number of cards remaining and deck_id are important. You can't draw from an empty deck and saving the deck_id will
    allow you to continue using the same deck as you play instead of creating a new one each time.

    <h3>Draw a Card:</h3>
    To draw a card, you need to call <span> "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/deck_id/draw/?count=X" </span>where "x" is the number of cards you
    want to draw from the deck and "deck_id" is replaced with your deck_id from creating the deck(s). As with everything returned by
    this API, it is in JSON format. It contains success, cards, decck_id, and remaining. Cards contains some very useful information.
    It contains an array of card objects returned from the API, depending on how many cards you requested. Each card object contains
    an image link, a value, a suit, and a code. The code contains the value and suit of the card, like "8C" for 8 of clubs.

    <h3>Reshuffle:</h3>
    If your deck is almost empty or empty, you have the option to reshuffle the cards. This is done by calling<span>
    "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/"deck_id"/shuffle/" </span> where "deck_id" is replaced with your deck_id. This will shuffle the deck that the API is storing for you so that it can be reused.
    Using this option also helps the API from filling up with unused decks. So, if possible, one should reshuffle instead of create a new deck.
   

    <h3>Custom Deck:</h3>
    You can create a custom deck to play with. This would be useful for Pinochle and other partial or weird decked games. To create
    a custom deck, call<span> "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?cards=" </span>where you add the card codes after "cards=" seperated by
    commas.

    <h3>Adding to Pile:</h3>
    Deck of Cards also allows the creation of a pile. This could be used as a discard pile for games such as War, Rummy, etc.
    This is done by calling<span> "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/"deck_id"/pile/"pile_name"/add/?cards=" </span>where "deck_id" is your deck
    id, "pile_name" is a name you create or the name of a pile you already created, and after "cards=" you add the card code(s) of the
    cards you wish to add to the pile. It is possible to create multiple piles for a single deck, but you cannot make a pile if you are
    using more than 1 deck. This returns the remaining cards in the deck, and an array of piles with the number of cards in the piles.

    <h3>Drawing from Pile:</h3>
    Drawing from a pile allows the user to draw any card that is inside the pile. It can be called with <span> "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/"deck_id"/pile/
    "pile_name"/draw/"?cards="" </span>where "deck_id" is your deck id, "pile_name" is the name of your pile, and "?cards=" is options. "?cards="
    will return a specific card in the pile. If you leave off "?cards=" it will return the top card. This function returns if it was successful,
    the deck_id, remaining card number, piles array, and an array of cards that were drawn.
