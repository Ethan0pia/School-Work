                In this assignment I implemented an OAuth 2.0 Server Side flow to create a user account to use with a RESTful API.
            </p>
            <p class="lead centered-text">
                This assignment requirements are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You need to implement a REST API
                    <li>
                        User accounts are supported (ie. there is data tied to specific users that only they can see or modify) AND the account system uses 3rd party provider,
                        there should be able to be an arbitrary number of accounts. Accounts *must* have access to some amount of account specific information that only they
                        can either access or modify.
                    <li>
                        There should be at least 2 entities and they should have at least 4 properties each
                    <li>
                        There should be at least one relationship between entities
                </ul>
            <p class="lead centered-text">
                The program will ask you to login to your google+ account. It will then generate a profile for that account and give you an ID to use for API requests based on your Google+ ID.
            <p class="lead centered-text">
                The ID is needed to access the user's profile. The profile will consist of an ID, a first name, a second name, an email, and their current car.
            <p class="lead centered-text">
                The second entity will be cars. Anyone can add cars to the database. The user can then search to find their car and add it's ID to their user profile. A car
                will have an ID, a make, a model, MSRP, and MPG.
            </p>
